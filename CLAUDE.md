# SwiftCut

A lightweight, local-first video editor built with Tauri (Rust) + React. Fast, no bloat, no forced cloud — the antithesis of ClipChamp.

## Architecture

pnpm monorepo orchestrated by **Nx**:

- `apps/desktop/` — the Tauri v2 desktop app
  - `src-frontend/` — React + Vite UI (the webview): TanStack Router/Query/Form, shadcn/ui
  - `src-tauri/` — Rust core: window, native access, and (later) the video pipeline
- `packages/` — shared libraries (`ui` — shadcn/ui components; `lint-config` — shared oxlint/oxfmt)
- `packages/supabase/` + `supabase/` — **DORMANT**. Kept for future cloud/AI features; nothing imports them and the app runs fully local without them. Do not wire them into the core editor.

## Conventions

- Group frontend feature code by domain (vertical slices), not by technology.
- Use `pnpm`, never `npm` or `yarn`. Orchestrate tasks with Nx (`nx run-many -t <target>`, `nx run <project>:<target>`).
- Frontend ↔ Rust: expose Rust functionality as `#[tauri::command]` and call it via `invoke()` from `@tauri-apps/api/core`.

## Environment & secrets

- The app is local-only and currently requires no env vars. `apps/desktop/src-frontend/env.ts` validates env once (zod) and exports a typed `env`; add `VITE_`-prefixed vars there when needed. Nothing else reads `import.meta.env` for config (Vite's built-in flags like `import.meta.env.DEV` are fine).

## Commands

See `scripts` in the root `package.json`. Key ones:

- `pnpm dev` — launch the desktop app (Tauri window)
- `pnpm dev:web` — run the frontend in a browser with fast HMR (no Rust rebuild)
- `pnpm build` — build the frontend; `pnpm bundle` — produce a desktop installer
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm test` — via Nx across the workspace
